**All Variants Preview** is a lightweight Android library that simplifies multi-orientation and UI mode previews in Jetpack Compose. It helps developers visualize their components across different device configurations — without writing repetitive preview annotations.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Compose preview annotations for multiple orientations and UI modes  
- ✅ Works seamlessly with Android Studio's preview tooling  
- ✅ Minimal setup, no runtime dependencies  
- ✅ OSS-compliant metadata and automated Maven Central publishing

---

## 🤔 Why Use This?

Avoid repetitive preview annotations and improve UI testing coverage across device configurations.  
Perfect for teams building scalable Compose UI libraries.

---

## 🚀 Installation

This library is published to [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.karthik-pro-engr/preview) and can be added directly to your project:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.karthik-pro-engr:preview:0.3.0-rc1")
